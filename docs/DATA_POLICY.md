# Data and generated-artifact policy

Scientific Phase A: `runtime/raw/<sha256>` retains exact prospective source bytes; `runtime/prospective` retains acquisition/failure receipts and reviewed policy artifacts. Both are local/generated and excluded from Git. Derived identity registries, historical replay inputs, full predictions and calibration reports remain in local checkpoints. Only curated counts, aggregate metrics, assumptions, hashes and limitations may enter `docs/evidence`. Reconstructed historical availability must remain labelled through every derived output.

Adopted 2026-09-24. The local project is authoritative; Git contains reviewed source, contracts and documentation. The initial GitHub baseline is private. Privacy of the repository never makes secrets or restricted data suitable for a commit.

Repository source-code rights **are not** sports-data rights. The [license policy](../LICENSE_POLICY.md) grants no general open-source license. Each external dataset retains its own attribution, license, terms, scope and redistribution conditions independently.

| Category | Git policy | Required treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authored source, scripts and schemas | Commit after review | No embedded credentials; document dependencies and ownership |
| Configuration templates | Commit only safe reviewed configuration | References to protected local files are allowed; values containing secrets are not |
| Curated test fixtures | Allowed when necessary, small and safe | Prefer synthetic input; preserve explicit labels and expected temporal/provenance behavior |
| Synthetic data | Only curated examples by default | Label generator, capture origin and observations; do not claim live evidence |
| Public/open external data | No automatic inclusion | Review redistribution rights, attribution, exact scope and value; record source URL, retrieval time, license and hash |
| Restricted or unverified external data | Do not commit | Block acquisition where policy is uncertain; never publish merely because bytes are accessible |
| Runtime database files and dumps | Do not commit | Local `runtime/sqlserver-lab/`, other runtime data and `data/` remain excluded |
| Checkpoints, handoff manifests, receipts and downloads | Do not commit by default | Preserve immutable local evidence; curate a sanitized report separately if needed |
| Curated evidence summaries | Commit after explicit field/content review | Small JSON under `docs/evidence/` with source hashes, historical scope and plain-string local coordinates; never raw artifact copies |
| Secrets, cookies, tokens, credentials and browser profiles | Never commit | Protected local storage only; secrets are not release assets or issue attachments |
| Models, weights and generated simulations | Do not commit by default | Keep `models/` and large derived output outside Git; future distribution requires licensing, size, provenance and reproduction review |
| Machine logs, caches, vendor packages and temporary files | Do not commit | Rebuild or retain locally as appropriate; preserve relevant failures in sanitized reports |

## Dataset ownership

SQL Server owns structured intelligence. MariaDB owns operational state and bounded presentation caches. DuckDB is the planned analytical laboratory; Parquet is planned large-history/archive storage. These future roles do not claim implemented workloads. Every materialized copy needs a declared purpose, source version, transformation, refresh/cutoff semantics and recovery rule. No automatic whole-dataset replication.

## Evidence and temporal integrity

Preserve source identity, URL, retrieval and observation times, hashes where available, parser/version, confidence, verification and terms/license state. Keep event time distinct from observation, availability, revision, ingestion and analysis cutoff. Corrections append versions with their own availability; historical replay cannot use later knowledge. Unknown timezone or historical availability remains unknown.

The [source matrix](../research/PUBLIC_SPORT_SOURCE_MATRIX.md) and [source policy](SPORT_SOURCE_POLICY.md) are the research entry points. A permitted local acquisition does not automatically authorize copying that dataset into GitHub. Curated third-party notices or license evidence retain attribution and do not become the repository's source-code license.

## Local evidence and publication

Ignore `runtime/` generated evidence, `data/`, `models/`, local credential files and downloaded binaries. Version-controlled examples and schemas belong in reviewed authored paths such as `tests/` and `config/`, not an exception exposing the runtime tree. Preserve existing local checkpoints when changing ignore rules; exclusion from Git does not authorize deletion.

Before staging, audit actual file contents and the staged set, including ignored/generated boundaries and unexpected large files. `.gitignore` is a selection aid, not a security guarantee. **LOCAL FORENSIC EVIDENCE** is the original ignored `runtime/checkpoints/` tree; **REPOSITORY-SAFE EVIDENCE** is the reviewed [docs/evidence](evidence/README.md) directory. Curated summaries select only small safe measurements, retain exact source SHA-256s, identify limitations and store `local_evidence_path` as a string. They are historical summaries, not a live rerun or an independent attestation.

Do not turn ignored checkpoint paths into broken GitHub Markdown links. Link to an appropriate curated summary when it actually supports the claim; preserve other source coordinates as explicitly local inline-code paths. Validate repository links against the actual staged file set, not the machine's broader local filesystem. Never upload raw runtime artifacts as Actions or release artifacts.
