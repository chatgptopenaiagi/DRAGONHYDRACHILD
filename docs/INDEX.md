# Documentation index

Repository entry points: [baseline report](reports/GITHUB_BASELINE.md), [operations and visibility](REPOSITORY_OPERATIONS.md), [curated evidence](evidence/README.md), [testing tiers](TESTING.md) and [ADR index](architecture/ADR_INDEX.md).

DRAGONHYDRA is an experimental local laboratory. V1 is the active roadmap stage; later stages are plans until their success gates have evidence. Start with the current records below. Existing document paths are retained to preserve history and working references.

## Reading historical evidence

Historical reports describe what was demonstrated at their recorded time. They do not prove current service health or complete later roadmap stages. Where a foundation document says SQL Server, sports persistence or presentation is deferred, consult the newer V1 reports, D014/D020 and current roadmap status.

**LOCAL FORENSIC EVIDENCE** remains under ignored `runtime/checkpoints/`. Raw handoffs, downloads, logs and credentials also remain local under ignored `runtime/`. Paths shown as inline code are local evidence coordinates, not files promised by a GitHub checkout. **REPOSITORY-SAFE EVIDENCE** lives in [docs/evidence](evidence/README.md): selected historical measurements, exact source-artifact hashes and explicit limitations. Release assets must never include the private runtime tree. Checkpoint immutability is enforced by application convention, not operating-system WORM storage. GitHub documentation links must be checked against the actual staged file set.
